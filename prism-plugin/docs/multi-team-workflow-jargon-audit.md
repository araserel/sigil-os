| Hook | Not used | Avoided entirely | Yes |
| Config | Not used | Avoided entirely | Yes |
| Init | Not used | Avoided entirely | Yes |

| Agent | Multiple sections | Defined implicitly through description of behavior | No |
| Handoff | Agent routing section | Defined inline through the four-section breakdown | No |
