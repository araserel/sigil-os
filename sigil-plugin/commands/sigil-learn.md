# Project Learnings

You manage the project's learning repository — patterns, gotchas, decisions, and feature notes accumulated during development.

## User Input

$ARGUMENTS
```

## Route by Arguments

### No arguments: `/sigil-learn`

Display current learnings summary.

**Process:**
1. Read `/.sigil/learnings/active/patterns.md`
2. Read `/.sigil/learnings/active/gotchas.md`
3. Read `/.sigil/learnings/active/decisions.md`
4. Count items in each category

**Output format:**
```
Project Learnings
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Patterns (X/30):
  • Always use RLS policies for user-scoped queries
  • Add loading states to all async UI components
  • Validate email format server-side
  ...

Gotchas (Y/30):
  • Supabase storage has 50MB default upload limit
  • Next.js middleware can't access Node APIs
  ...

Recent Decisions (Z/20):
  • [Jan 15] Auth: Chose JWT over sessions
  • [Jan 12] UI: Using Tailwind, not styled-components
  ...

Active Features: N
  • 001-user-auth (5 notes)
  • 002-product-catalog (3 notes)

Run '/sigil-learn --review' to prune and promote.
Run '/sigil-learn --search <query>' to search.
```

**Shared context section** (only when `~/.sigil/registry.json` exists and current project is connected):

After the local learnings summary, also read from `~/.sigil/cache/shared/learnings/` and `~/.sigil/cache/shared/queue/`, then append:

```
Shared Context
--------------
  Repo: my-org/platform-context
  Shared patterns: X (from N projects)
  Shared gotchas:  Y (from N projects)
  Pending syncs:   Z queued
  Last sync: 2026-02-09 14:30
```

If shared context is not active (no sentinel or project not in registry), do NOT show this section.

### `--review`: `/sigil-learn --review`

Invoke the `learning-review` skill for interactive review.

**Process:**
1. Invoke `learning-review` skill
2. Follow its interactive prompts
3. Report summary when complete

### `--search <query>`: `/sigil-learn --search auth`

Search across all learnings (local and shared).

**Process:**
1. Read all files in `/.sigil/learnings/active/`
2. If shared context is active, also read files in `~/.sigil/cache/shared/learnings/`
3. Search for query term (case-insensitive)
4. Return matching entries with source (label shared results with repo name)

**Output format:**
```
Search: "auth"

Results (5 matches):

[Pattern] Use RLS policies for user-scoped queries
  → patterns.md

[Decision] Chose JWT over sessions (Jan 15)
  → decisions.md

[Gotcha] Supabase auth.signUp() doesn't auto-confirm in dev
  → gotchas.md

[Note] Task 2: Registration endpoint needed email toggle
  → features/001-user-auth.md

[Note] Task 5: Added refresh token rotation
  → features/001-user-auth.md
```

If any category exceeds 80% of limit:

⚠️  Gotchas at 85% capacity. Consider running /sigil-learn --review

## Empty State

If no learnings exist yet:

```
Project Learnings
=================

No learnings captured yet.

Learnings are automatically recorded as you complete tasks:
  • Patterns — Reusable rules discovered during development
  • Gotchas — Traps and pitfalls to avoid
  • Decisions — Architectural choices and their rationale

Start building features with /sigil to begin capturing learnings.
