# Skill: Code Reviewer

## Purpose

Perform structured code review against project standards, constitution principles, and software engineering best practices. This skill provides a thorough review of code quality, architecture adherence, and maintainability before changes proceed to security review or deployment.

## When to Invoke

- qa-validator passes all checks
- User requests `/sigil-review` or "review code"
- Entering Review phase from Validate phase
- Changes are ready for final quality assessment

## Inputs

**Required:**
```json
{
  "changed_files": ["src/services/auth.ts", "src/models/user.ts"],
  "spec_path": "/.sigil/specs/001-feature/spec.md"
}
```

**Optional:**
```json
{
  "plan_path": "/.sigil/specs/001-feature/plan.md",
  "constitution_path": "/.sigil/constitution.md",
  "review_depth": "standard | thorough",
  "focus_areas": ["error_handling", "architecture"],
  "previous_review": "/.sigil/specs/001-feature/reviews/code-review-v1.md",
  "qa_fix_metadata": {
    "implementation_modified": false,
    "files_changed_classified": {},
    "fix_loop_summary": ""
  }
}
```

**Auto-loaded:**
- Constitution from `/.sigil/constitution.md`
- Project coding standards
- Existing codebase patterns

## Review Criteria

### 1. Code Style (Constitution Article 2)

**Checks:**
- Naming conventions followed
- Consistent formatting
- File organization
- Import structure
- Comment quality (not quantity)

**Examples:**
```
SUGGESTION: Variable 'x' should have a descriptive name
  File: auth.ts:42
  Current: const x = getUserById(id)
  Suggested: const user = getUserById(id)
```

### 2. Architecture (Constitution Article 5)

**Checks:**
- Follows existing patterns in codebase
- No unnecessary abstractions
- Appropriate separation of concerns
- Dependencies in correct direction
- Single responsibility principle

**Examples:**
```
WARNING: This creates a new pattern inconsistent with existing code
  File: services/auth.ts
  Issue: Using class-based service when codebase uses functions
  Recommendation: Follow existing functional pattern or document why different
```

### 3. Error Handling

**Checks:**
- All error cases handled
- Errors logged appropriately
- User-facing errors are helpful
- No swallowed errors
- Appropriate error types used

**Examples:**
```
WARNING: Error is caught but not logged
  File: auth.ts:88
  Code: catch (e) { return null; }
  Suggested: Log error before returning, or re-throw with context
```

### 4. Complexity

**Checks:**
- Functions reasonably sized (guideline: ~20 lines)
- Cyclomatic complexity reasonable
- Nesting depth manageable (max 3-4 levels)
- No overly clever solutions

**Examples:**
```
SUGGESTION: Function is complex (cyclomatic complexity: 12)
  File: validator.ts:validateInput()
  Recommendation: Consider breaking into smaller functions
```

### 5. DRY Principle

**Checks:**
- No duplicate code
- Shared logic extracted appropriately
- But not over-abstracted (per Article 5)

**Examples:**
```
SUGGESTION: Similar code in 3 locations
  Files: auth.ts:45, user.ts:67, session.ts:23
  Pattern: Error formatting logic
  Recommendation: Extract to shared utility if used 3+ times
```

### 6. Testability

**Checks:**
- Code is testable (dependencies injectable)
- No hidden dependencies
- Side effects isolated
- Pure functions where possible

### 7. Documentation

**Checks:**
- Public APIs documented
- Complex logic has comments explaining "why"
- No redundant comments explaining "what"
- README updated if needed

### 8. Constitution Compliance

**Checks:**
- Article 2: Code style standards
- Article 5: Anti-abstraction principle
- Article 6: Simplicity preference
- Any project-specific rules

## Review Report Template

```markdown
# Code Review: [Feature Name]

**Review ID:** CR-001
**Reviewer:** Code Reviewer Skill
**Date:** [Timestamp]
**Status:** [APPROVED | CHANGES REQUESTED | BLOCKED]

## Summary

| Category | Blockers | Warnings | Suggestions |
|----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Style | 0 | 1 | 2 |
| Architecture | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| Error Handling | 0 | 1 | 0 |

<!-- Only include QA Fix Impact Notice when implementation_modified is true -->
## QA Fix Impact Notice

> **Implementation was modified during the QA fix loop.** The following implementation files were changed by qa-fixer, not the original developer. Review these with extra scrutiny.

| File | Category |
|------|----------|
| [file] | Implementation |

## Findings

### Warnings

#### W001: Error not logged before return
**File:** src/auth.ts:88
**Category:** Error Handling
**Constitution:** Article 2 (Code Standards)

```typescript
// Current
catch (e) {
  return null;
}

// Suggested
catch (e) {
  logger.error('Authentication failed', { error: e });
  return null;
}
```

### Suggestions

#### S001: Consider descriptive variable name
**File:** src/auth.ts:42
**Category:** Style

```typescript
// Current
const x = getUserById(id);

// Suggested
const user = getUserById(id);
```

## Commendations

- Good separation of concerns in service layer
- Comprehensive error types defined
- Tests cover edge cases well

## Approval Status

[APPROVED] — No blocking issues found. Warnings are recommendations for improvement.

**Conditions:** None

**Next Step:** Proceed to security review
```

## Pre-Execution Check

Before starting, update `.sigil/project-context.md`:
- Set **Current Phase** to `review`
- Set **Feature** to the feature being reviewed
- Set **Spec Path** to the active spec directory
- Set **Last Updated** to the current timestamp

If `.sigil/project-context.md` does not exist, create it using the State Tracking format from the `/sigil` command.

## Workflow

```
1. Receive files and spec for review
1b. If qa_fix_metadata provided and implementation_modified is true:
    - Flag implementation files from files_changed_classified for priority review
    - These files were modified during the QA fix loop, not the original implementation
2. Load constitution and project standards
3. For each file:
   a. Parse and analyze structure
   b. Check against review criteria
   c. Compare with existing codebase patterns
   d. Generate findings
4. Cross-file analysis:
   a. Check for duplicated code
   b. Verify architecture consistency
   c. Check dependency directions
5. Compile findings by severity
6. Determine approval status:
   - No blockers → Approved (may have warnings/suggestions)
   - Has blockers → Changes Requested
7. Generate review report
8. Return results
```

## Tech Debt Persistence

After completing the review, if any findings have `severity: "suggestion"`, persist them to `/.sigil/tech-debt.md`:

1. **Read** `/.sigil/tech-debt.md` (create if it doesn't exist)
2. **Duplicate check** — Skip if an entry with the same file and concept already exists
3. **Append** each new suggestion using the entry format below
4. **Cap at 50 items** — If the file exceeds 50 entries, add a warning comment: `<!-- Tech debt backlog at capacity. Review and triage before adding more. -->`
5. **Silent operation** — Do not mention tech-debt persistence to the user unless asked

**Entry format:**

```markdown
- **[Short description]**
  - Feature: [feature-id]
  - Review: [CR-###]
  - File: [file:line]
  - Category: [style | architecture | error_handling | performance | complexity | DRY]
  - Suggested Fix: [Brief suggestion]
  - Added: [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

**File header** (created once):

```markdown
# Tech Debt Backlog

> Non-blocking suggestions from code reviews. Review periodically.

---
```

## Severity Guidelines

### Blocker
Must be fixed before approval:
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss potential
- Breaking existing functionality
- Constitution violations (hard rules)

### Warning
Should be fixed, but can proceed:
- Code quality concerns
- Performance issues (non-critical)
- Pattern inconsistencies
- Missing error handling

### Suggestion
Nice to have improvements:
- Style preferences
- Minor refactoring opportunities
- Documentation additions
- Test coverage expansion

## Error Handling

### File Not Found
```
Cannot review file: [Path]
Reason: File not found or inaccessible

Options:
A) Verify file path and retry
B) Exclude from review scope
C) Escalate
```

### Large File Warning
```
File exceeds review threshold: [Path]
Size: [N] lines (threshold: 500)

Recommendation: Consider breaking into smaller modules.
Proceeding with focused review on changed sections only.
```
