# Skill: Ticket Loader

## Purpose

Bridge external issue trackers into the Sigil workflow. When a user provides a ticket key (e.g., `PROJ-123`) instead of a plain-text feature description, this skill fetches the ticket data, enriches it with parent/epic context, categorizes the work type, and produces a structured context object that the orchestrator can route through the standard pipeline.

## When to Invoke

- User provides a ticket key matching `[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-\d+` pattern as input to `/sigil`
- Orchestrator detects ticket-key format in Step 2

## Inputs

**Required:**
- `ticket_key`: string — The ticket identifier (e.g., `PROJ-123`, `TEAM-456`)

**Auto-loaded:**
- `config`: object — `.sigil/config.yaml` integrations section for adapter lookup

## Process

### Step 1: Validate Adapter

1. Extract project prefix from ticket key (everything before the `-`)
2. Read `.sigil/config.yaml` and check `integrations:` section for a matching adapter
3. Match by `project_keys` array in adapter config
4. If no adapter found for this project prefix:
   ```
   No integration configured for project "{prefix}".

   To use ticket-driven workflows, connect to a shared context
   repo that has adapter configs, or add one manually to
   .sigil/config.yaml.

   You can still describe the feature in plain text instead.
   ```
   → Return error, let orchestrator fall back to plain-text input

5. If adapter found, verify MCP tools are available (use `ToolSearch`)
6. If MCP tools not available:
   ```
   {Adapter name} MCP is not configured in this session.
   Ticket loading requires the {MCP server} connection.

   You can describe the feature in plain text instead,
   or configure MCP and try again.
   ```
   → Return error with fallback guidance

### Step 2: Fetch Ticket

1. Invoke the adapter's Fetch Ticket protocol (e.g., Jira adapter's Fetch Ticket)
2. Pass: `ticket_key`
3. Receive: ticket data (summary, description, type, priority, status, labels, story_points, assignee, reporter)
4. If ticket not found:
   ```
   Could not find ticket {ticket_key}. Check that:
   - The ticket key is correct
   - You have access to this project
   - The ticket hasn't been deleted
   ```
   → Return error

### Step 3: Fetch Parent Context

1. If the ticket has a parent/epic link:
   a. Invoke the adapter's Fetch Parent protocol
   b. Pass: parent ticket key
   c. Receive: parent summary, description, acceptance criteria
2. If no parent link: skip (standalone ticket)
3. If parent fetch fails: continue without parent context (non-blocking)

### Step 4: Categorize

Map the ticket's issue type and labels to a Sigil work category:

| Category | Mapping Criteria |
|----------|-----------------|
| `bug` | Issue type = Bug, Defect, or label contains "bug" |
| `feature` | Issue type = Story, User Story, Feature, or label contains "feature" |
| `enhancement` | Issue type = Task, Improvement, or label contains "enhancement" |
| `maintenance` | Issue type = Chore, Tech Debt, or label contains "maintenance", "tech-debt", "refactor" |

**Priority rules:**
1. Adapter-specific category mapping takes precedence (from adapter config)
2. Labels override issue type if both are present
3. Default to `enhancement` if no match

**Category-specific routing hints:**
- `maintenance` → suggest Quick Flow, skip complexity assessor
- `bug` without security labels → cap at Standard track
- `feature` → full pipeline (no override)
- `enhancement` → standard assessment

### Step 5: Assemble Enriched Context

Build the structured context object:

```json
{
  "source": "ticket",
  "ticket_key": "PROJ-123",
  "category": "feature",
  "adapter": "jira",
  "ticket_metadata": {
    "summary": "As a user, I want to reset my password",
    "description": "Full ticket description...",
    "type": "Story",
    "priority": "High",
    "status": "To Do",
    "labels": ["auth", "user-facing"],
    "story_points": 5,
    "assignee": "jane@example.com",
    "reporter": "pm@example.com",
    "related_ticket_count": 3
  },
  "parent_context": {
    "key": "PROJ-100",
    "summary": "User Authentication Epic",
    "description": "Epic description..."
  },
  "enriched_description": "Feature: As a user, I want to reset my password\n\nFrom ticket PROJ-123 (Story, High priority, 5 story points)\nEpic: User Authentication (PROJ-100)\n\nFull ticket description...",
  "routing_hints": {
    "suggested_track": null,
    "skip_complexity": false,
    "cap_track": null
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Hand Off

Return the enriched context to the orchestrator. The orchestrator uses `enriched_description` as the feature description input and passes `ticket_metadata` through the pipeline for downstream skills (complexity-assessor, handoff-back).

## Outputs

**Handoff Data:**
```json
{
  "source": "ticket",
  "ticket_key": "PROJ-123",
  "category": "feature|bug|enhancement|maintenance",
  "adapter": "jira",
  "ticket_metadata": { ... },
  "parent_context": { ... },
  "enriched_description": "...",
  "routing_hints": { ... }
}
```

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| No adapter for project prefix | Show guidance, fall back to plain text input |
| MCP tools not available | Show guidance, fall back to plain text input |
| Ticket not found | Show error with troubleshooting hints |
| Parent fetch fails | Continue without parent context (non-blocking) |
| Adapter returns partial data | Use what's available, default missing fields |
| Config file missing | "No integrations configured. Describe your feature in plain text." |
| Multiple adapters match prefix | Use first match, log warning |
