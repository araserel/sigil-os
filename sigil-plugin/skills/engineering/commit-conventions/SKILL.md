# Skill: Commit Conventions

## Purpose

Define and enforce commit message conventions for a project. Detects existing patterns, reads constitution-defined standards, and applies Conventional Commits as the default format. Ensures every commit message is consistent, traceable, and informative.

## Type

Reference — this skill provides guidance and validation rather than producing a persistent artifact.

## When to Invoke

- Developer is about to commit code
- Code review identifies inconsistent commit messages
- New project needs commit conventions established
- User asks about commit message format
- Pre-commit validation of message format

## Inputs

**Required:**
- `action`: string — One of: `format`, `validate`, `detect`, `configure`

**Optional:**
- `message`: string — Commit message to validate or format
- `branch_name`: string — Current branch name for ticket prefix extraction
- `changed_files`: string[] — List of changed files for scope inference

**Auto-loaded:**
- `constitution`: string — `/.sigil/constitution.md` (Article 2 for commit conventions)
- `project_context`: string — `/.sigil/project-context.md`

## Process

### Step 1: Load Convention Source

```
1. Read /.sigil/constitution.md
2. Check Article 2 (Engineering Standards) for commit convention definitions
3. If constitution defines conventions:
   - Extract format pattern, allowed types, scope rules
   - Use constitution as authoritative source
4. If constitution has no commit conventions:
   - Fall back to Conventional Commits as default format
5. Scan recent git history (last 50 commits) to detect existing patterns
6. Note any deviations between constitution and actual usage
```

### Step 2: Detect Project Context

```
1. Read current branch name via: git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
2. Extract ticket prefix using regex: [A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-\d+
   - Match patterns like PROJ-123, FEAT-42, BUG-7
   - Check branch naming formats:
     - feature/PROJ-123-description
     - PROJ-123/description
     - PROJ-123-description
     - fix/PROJ-123
3. Detect if project uses any commit tooling:
   - commitlint config (.commitlintrc, commitlint.config.js)
   - husky hooks (.husky/commit-msg)
   - conventional-changelog config
4. If tooling detected, align conventions with tooling config
```

### Step 3: Define Convention Rules

The default convention follows Conventional Commits with optional extensions:

**Message Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Allowed Types:**

| Type | Usage |
|------|-------|
| `feat` | New feature or capability |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation-only changes |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace, no code change |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring, no behavior change |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Build process, tooling, dependencies |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration changes |
| `revert` | Reverting a previous commit |

**Scope Rules:**
```
1. Scope is optional but recommended
2. Use the primary module, component, or area affected
3. Keep scope to a single word or hyphenated-phrase
4. Examples: auth, api, user-profile, database, ci
```

**Subject Rules:**
```
1. Imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
2. No period at the end
3. Lowercase first letter
4. Maximum 72 characters for the full header line
5. Summarize the "what", not the "how"
```

**Ticket Reference Rules:**
```
1. If ticket prefix detected from branch: include in footer
2. Format: Refs: PROJ-123 or Closes: PROJ-123
3. If constitution specifies ticket placement (subject vs footer), follow that
4. Multiple tickets separated by commas: Refs: PROJ-123, PROJ-124
```

**Breaking Changes:**
```
1. Add ! after type/scope: feat(api)!: remove deprecated endpoint
2. Include BREAKING CHANGE: footer with description
3. Always document migration path in body
```

### Step 4: Execute Action

**Action: `format`**
```
1. Receive raw description of changes
2. Infer type from changed files and description:
   - Test files only → test
   - Docs files only → docs
   - New feature code → feat
   - Bug description → fix
   - Restructuring → refactor
3. Infer scope from primary directory of changes
4. Extract ticket from branch name if available
5. Compose message following convention rules
6. Return formatted message
```

**Action: `validate`**
```
1. Receive commit message
2. Check header format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
3. Verify type is in allowed list
4. Verify subject is imperative mood (heuristic check)
5. Verify header length ≤ 72 characters
6. Check for ticket reference if branch has ticket prefix
7. Check body/footer formatting if present
8. Return validation result with specific issues
```

**Action: `detect`**
```
1. Read last 50 commit messages from git log
2. Classify each message by pattern:
   - Conventional Commits format
   - Ticket-prefixed (PROJ-123: message)
   - Freeform
   - Angular-style
3. Report dominant pattern and consistency percentage
4. Identify most-used types and scopes
5. Note any ticket reference patterns
6. Return detection report
```

**Action: `configure`**
```
1. Analyze detected patterns (run detect first)
2. Propose convention rules aligned with existing patterns
3. Present recommendation to user in plain language
4. If user approves, suggest constitution Article 2 update
5. Do NOT modify constitution directly — hand off to constitution skill
```

### Step 5: Branch Naming Conventions

Define standard branch naming patterns (reference only — not enforced):

| Pattern | Usage | Example |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `feature/<ticket>-<slug>` | New features | `feature/PROJ-123-user-auth` |
| `fix/<ticket>-<slug>` | Bug fixes | `fix/PROJ-456-login-crash` |
| `chore/<slug>` | Maintenance | `chore/update-dependencies` |
| `docs/<slug>` | Documentation | `docs/api-reference` |
| `release/<version>` | Release prep | `release/2.1.0` |
| `hotfix/<slug>` | Urgent fixes | `hotfix/security-patch` |

## Outputs

### Formatted Message (action: format)

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow

Implement Google and GitHub OAuth providers using NextAuth.
Includes callback handling and session persistence.

Refs: PROJ-123
```

### Validation Result (action: validate)

```json
{
  "valid": false,
  "message": "Added new login feature",
  "issues": [
    {
      "rule": "type-required",
      "message": "Missing type prefix. Expected format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>",
      "suggestion": "feat: add new login feature"
    },
    {
      "rule": "imperative-mood",
      "message": "Use imperative mood: 'add' instead of 'added'",
      "suggestion": "feat: add new login feature"
    }
  ],
  "suggested_message": "feat(auth): add new login feature\n\nRefs: PROJ-456"
}
```

### Detection Report (action: detect)

```json
{
  "total_commits_analyzed": 50,
  "dominant_pattern": "conventional",
  "consistency": 0.78,
  "types_used": {
    "feat": 18,
    "fix": 12,
    "chore": 8,
    "docs": 5,
    "refactor": 4,
    "test": 3
  },
  "scopes_used": ["auth", "api", "ui", "db"],
  "ticket_pattern": "PROJ-\\d+",
  "ticket_placement": "footer",
  "deviations": [
    "11 commits lack type prefix",
    "3 commits exceed 72 character header limit"
  ]
}
```

## Human Checkpoints

| Action | Tier | Behavior |
|--------|------|----------|
| format | Auto | Returns formatted message, no approval needed |
| validate | Auto | Returns validation result, no approval needed |
| detect | Auto | Returns detection report, no approval needed |
| configure | Review | User reviews and approves proposed conventions |

## Error Handling

| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| No git repository | Cannot detect patterns — use default Conventional Commits |
| No commits in history | Cannot detect patterns — use default Conventional Commits |
| Constitution not found | Use Conventional Commits as default |
| Branch name unparseable | Skip ticket prefix extraction |
| Commit tooling config conflicts with constitution | Flag conflict, constitution takes precedence |
| Ambiguous type inference | Ask user to specify type |

## Example Invocations

**Format a commit message:**
```
Input: "I fixed the bug where users couldn't log in with special characters in their password"
Branch: fix/PROJ-789-special-char-login

Output: fix(auth): handle special characters in password login

Resolve encoding issue for passwords containing &, <, > characters
during the authentication flow.

Closes: PROJ-789
```

**Validate a commit message:**
```
Input: "updated the tests"

Output:
  valid: false
  issues:
    - Missing type prefix
    - Past tense "updated" should be "update"
  suggestion: "test: update test suite"
```

## Integration Points

- **Invoked by:** `developer` agent during commit phase, `orchestrator` for convention setup
- **References:** `/.sigil/constitution.md` Article 2
- **Complements:** Code review skill (reviews commit message quality)
- **Works with:** Git hooks (commit-msg) for automated validation

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency over perfection** — Pick a convention and stick with it
2. **Ticket traceability** — Always reference tickets when they exist
3. **Atomic commits** — One logical change per commit makes conventions easier
4. **Body for context** — Use the body to explain "why", not "what"
5. **Scope narrows focus** — Helps reviewers understand impact area at a glance
6. **Breaking changes are loud** — Always use `!` suffix and footer for visibility
