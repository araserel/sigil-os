# Command Reference

> Quick reference for all Sigil commands.

---

## Command Overview

| Command | Purpose | When to Use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/sigil` | **Unified entry point** — status, start, resume | Starting any workflow |
| `/sigil-setup` | Initialize Sigil OS in a new project | First-time project setup |
| `/sigil-handoff` | Generate engineer review package | Ready for technical review |
| `/sigil-constitution` | View or edit project rules | First-time setup or updates |
| `/sigil-learn` | View, search, or review learnings | Reviewing institutional memory |
| `/sigil-connect` | Connect project to shared context repo | Multi-project sharing setup |
| `/sigil-profile` | Generate or view project profile | Describing your tech stack and APIs |
| `/sigil-update` | Check for and install Sigil updates | Keeping Sigil current |

---

## Command Flow

`/sigil` is the recommended entry point. It detects your project state and routes to the right phase automatically. All workflow phases (specification, clarification, planning, tasks, validation, review) are handled automatically by the orchestrator.

```
/sigil-setup (one-time project setup)
        ↓
/sigil "description" (start a feature — all phases run automatically)
        ↓
    Specify → Clarify → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Validate → Review
        ↓
/sigil-handoff (when ready for engineer review)
```

You can use `/sigil` or `/sigil status` at any point to see where you are.

---

## /sigil

The unified entry point for all Sigil workflows. This is the recommended way to interact with Sigil.

### Syntax

```
/sigil
/sigil "feature description"
/sigil continue
/sigil status
/sigil help
```

### Variants

| Usage | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/sigil` | Show status dashboard and suggest next action |
| `/sigil "description"` | Start building a new feature from your description |
| `/sigil continue` | Resume where you left off |
| `/sigil status` | Show detailed workflow status |
| `/sigil help` | Show all available commands |

### What It Does

1. Runs a **preflight check** to verify Sigil is installed correctly
2. Loads your project context from `project-context.md`
3. Detects your current workflow state
4. Routes to the appropriate action:
   - No active workflow → Suggests starting one
   - Active workflow → Shows status and suggests next step
   - With a description → Starts the spec-first workflow

### Natural Language Alternatives

You don't need to remember the exact syntax. These all work:

| Instead of... | You can say... |
|---------------|----------------|
| `/sigil "Add login"` | "I want to add user login" |
| `/sigil status` | "What's the progress?" |
| `/sigil continue` | "Keep going" or "Next step" |
| `/sigil help` | "What can you do?" |

### When to Use

- **Every time you start a session** — `/sigil` orients you
- **Starting a new feature** — `/sigil "your description"`
- **Returning after a break** — `/sigil continue`

---

## /sigil-constitution

View or edit your project's rules and standards.

### Syntax

```
/sigil-constitution
```

### What It Does

1. If no constitution exists: Guides you through creating one
2. If constitution exists: Shows current rules and allows updates

### First-Time Setup

When you run `/sigil-constitution` for the first time, Sigil asks about:

1. **Technology Stack** — What languages and frameworks to use
2. **Code Standards** — Naming conventions and style rules
3. **Testing Requirements** — What level of testing is needed
4. **Security Mandates** — Authentication and data protection rules
5. **Architecture Principles** — Design patterns to follow
6. **Approval Requirements** — What needs human review
7. **Accessibility Standards** — Inclusivity requirements

### Example Session

```
Sigil: Let's set up your project constitution.
I'll ask a few questions about your preferences.

What programming language will this project use?
> TypeScript

What framework, if any?
> Next.js

What database will you use?
> PostgreSQL

...
```

### Expected Output

```markdown
# Project Constitution

## Article 1: Technology Stack
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL

## Article 2: Code Standards
- All functions must have explicit return types
- Use camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components

## Article 3: Testing Requirements
- All API endpoints must have integration tests
- Minimum 60% code coverage

...
```

### When to Use

- **First time:** At project start, before any features
- **Updates:** When project standards need to change

### Why It Matters

The constitution ensures:
- Consistent decisions across all features
- AI agents follow your project's rules
- No need to repeat preferences

- After major tech stack changes
- When you want sibling projects to know about your APIs or events

### Example

```
/sigil-profile
```

**Sigil responds:**
```
Project Profile Setup
==============================

I scanned your project and found:

  Languages: TypeScript, CSS
  Frameworks: Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS
  Testing: Jest, Playwright
  Infrastructure: (none detected)

Look right? [Y/n]: y

What does this project do? (1-2 sentences)
