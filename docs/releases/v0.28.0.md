# Sigil OS v0.28.0 — Release Notes

**Released:** February 21, 2026

## What's New

### Smarter Feature Routing

When you describe a feature to Sigil, it now automatically assesses how complex the work is before deciding how to handle it. Simple changes (bug fixes, small tweaks) get the **Quick Flow** — a faster path that skips unnecessary steps. Bigger features get the full workflow with detailed specifications and planning.

Previously, all plain-text feature descriptions went straight to the full specification process. Now Sigil picks the right level of process for the work.

### Better Design and Research Support

For features that involve user interfaces, Sigil now automatically brings in the UI/UX Designer to handle component design, accessibility, and framework selection — right after clarifying requirements and before technical planning.

For complex Enterprise-track features, Sigil now routes through the Researcher and ADR Writer when the technical plan identifies unknowns or significant architectural decisions. This was already defined in Sigil's architecture but wasn't being executed.

### Clearer Security Reviews

Code review and security review are now separate, sequential steps. Security review only runs when your changes touch sensitive areas (authentication, user data, payments, etc.), keeping the process efficient for changes that don't need it.

## What Changed

- **Quick Flow constitution check** now blocks if your project doesn't have a constitution set up (previously it warned and continued, which could lead to inconsistent specs).
- **Project setup** (`/sigil-setup`) now creates a waivers file during setup, so override tracking works from the first time you use it.
- **Help output** now shows the ticket command (`/sigil PROJ-123`) and configuration command (`/sigil-config`).
- **Visual separators** standardized across all output formats for consistency.

## Cleanup

- Removed 8 unused template files that were duplicated inline in skills. This doesn't change any behavior — just housekeeping.
- Fixed several command name references that were using old short names instead of the `/sigil-*` prefix.
- Added a new automated check to the development linter that catches drift between workflow definitions and the orchestrator.

## Upgrading from v0.27.0

No action needed. Install the update and continue using Sigil as usual. All existing projects, constitutions, and specifications are fully compatible.

## Known Issues

- Enterprise track entry is now fully documented but hasn't been end-to-end tested with a live project. If you encounter issues with Enterprise-track routing, please report them.
- The workflow linter's chain-alignment check produces expected warnings for Discovery chain skills (these are routed separately and don't appear in the main orchestrator).
