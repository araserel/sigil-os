# Skill: Deploy Checker

## Purpose

Validate that changes are ready for deployment to the target environment. This skill is the final gate before deployment, ensuring all quality checks have passed, reviews are complete, and the deployment has proper safeguards in place.

## When to Invoke

- After security-reviewer completes
- User requests `/deploy-check` or "check deployment readiness"
- Before deploying to any environment
- As part of CI/CD pipeline gate

## Inputs

**Required:**
```json
{
  "spec_path": "/specs/001-feature/spec.md",
  "target_environment": "development | staging | production"
}
```

**Optional:**
```json
{
  "validation_report": "/specs/001-feature/qa/validation.md",
  "review_reports": [
    "/specs/001-feature/reviews/code-review.md",
    "/specs/001-feature/reviews/security-review.md"
  ],
  "has_migrations": true,
  "migration_files": ["migrations/001_add_users.sql"],
  "feature_flags": ["feature_new_auth"],
  "rollback_plan": "/specs/001-feature/rollback.md"
}
```

**Auto-loaded:**
- Constitution (for deployment requirements)
- CI/CD configuration
- Environment configuration

- CI/CD environment definitions

### 6. Feature Flags (If applicable)

**Check:** Feature flags configured for target environment

**Verify:**
- Flag exists in configuration
- Default state documented
- Rollout plan defined (if gradual)

### 7. Rollback Plan (Recommended for production)

**Check:** Rollback procedure documented

**Verify:**
- Steps to revert code changes
- Database rollback procedure (if migrations)
- Feature flag disable procedure
- Verification steps post-rollback

### 8. Monitoring & Alerting

**Check:** Observability configured

**Verify:**
- Error tracking active
- Key metrics identified
- Alerts configured for failures
- Dashboard updated (if applicable)

### 9. Documentation

**Check:** User-facing changes documented

**Verify:**
- README updated (if applicable)
- API documentation updated (if applicable)
- Changelog entry added

## Workflow

```
1. Receive deployment request with target environment
2. Load all review reports and validation results
3. Determine required checks for environment
4. Verify each checklist item:
   a. Check report exists
   b. Verify status is passing
   c. Confirm no blocking issues
5. Check environment-specific requirements:
   a. Migrations (if applicable)
   b. Env vars (if new ones added)
   c. Feature flags (if used)
6. Assess deployment risk
7. Determine approval requirement
8. Generate readiness report
9. Return results with recommendation
```

## Error Handling

### Missing Reports
```
Deployment blocked: Missing required report.

Missing: [Report type]
Expected at: [Path]

Options:
A) Generate missing report (invoke skill)
B) Skip check with documentation
C) Block deployment
```

### Stale Reports
```
Warning: Report may be stale.

Report: [Type]
Generated: [Timestamp]
Last code change: [Timestamp]

Recommend: Re-run [skill] to ensure current.
```

### Migration Validation Failed
```
Deployment blocked: Migration validation failed.

Error: [Migration error message]

Options:
A) Fix migration and retry
B) Rollback migration changes
C) Escalate to DBA
```

## Approval Matrix

| Environment | Security Changes | DB Changes | Normal Changes |
|-------------|------------------|------------|----------------|
| Development | Auto | Auto | Auto |
| Staging | Review | Review | Review |
| Production | Approve | Approve | Approve |

## Integration

### Receiving from security-reviewer
```json
{
  "handoff_from": "security-reviewer",
  "security_status": "approved",
  "security_report": "/specs/.../reviews/security-review.md"
}
```

### Passing to DevOps Agent
```json
{
  "handoff_to": "devops-agent",
  "deploy_status": "ready",
  "deploy_report": "/specs/.../reviews/deploy-readiness.md",
  "environment": "production",
  "approval_required": true,
  "deploy_steps": [...]
}
```

## Escalation Triggers

Escalate when:
- Security review has unresolved high/critical findings
- Migrations are irreversible for production
- Required reports are missing and can't be generated
- Environment configuration incomplete
- Multiple warnings for production deployment

## Notes

- Be stricter for production than staging/dev
- Flag missing recommended items but don't block for them
- Consider deployment timing (avoid high-traffic periods)
- Ensure rollback is tested when possible
- Production requires explicit human approval always
